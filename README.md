# Data Structure and Algorithms

- Data Structures allow us to store and retrive data efficiently. Algorithms allow us to solve problems in a clearly defined way.
- Having a good grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms will enable me to develop solutions that will run efficiently.


## Roadmap

- Data structures 

- Algorithms
